    <p>Water is the most important element in the agriculture.The water helps the plants to grow.</p>
    <p>Farmers can grow their plants by these three source of water:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Rainfall:<br>
            It is important to understand the relation between rainfall and agriculture as rainfall is the major factor
            in the growth and production of food crops both at the germination and fruit development stage. Rainfall can
            directly impact the agriculture.Most of the farmers depend on rainfall because rainfall at correct time can
            reduce the investment on Irrigation</li><BR>
        <li>Ground water:<br>
            Groundwater is water that exists underground in saturated zones beneath the land surface.examples for ground
            water are wells and springs. These wells and springs help in irrigating the land with help of ground water.
            Groundwater can subsidize water availability during drought and enhance crop yield, but when groundwater too
            shallow, such as during flooding, it limits oxygen availability to roots and harms crop productivity.
        </li><br>
        <li>Surface water:<br>
            Surface water is any body of water above ground.examples for surface water are reservoirs,rivers,streams,ponds,lakes and tanks.
        </li><br>
         <p>Farmers can also get water through the method called Irrigation.Irrigation is the artificial application of
            water to the soil through various systems of tubes, pumps, and sprays.Irrigation is a popular source of
            water in the area where rainfall is irregular.There are many types of irrigation</p>
        <p>Here are some Irrigation types:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Sprinkler irrigation:<br>
                Water is distributed from a central location by overhead high-pressure sprinklers or from sprinklers
                from the moving platform.this is one of the most popular type of irrigation.
            </li>
            <li>Drip irrigation:<br>
                In this type, drops of water are delivered near the roots of the plants. This type of irrigation is
                rarely used as it requires more maintenance</li>
            <li>Surface Irrigation:<br>
                In this system, no irrigation pump is involved. Here, water is distributed across the land by gravity.
            </li>
            <li>Localized Irrigation:<br>
                In this system, water is applied to each plant through a network of pipes under low pressure.</li>
            <li>Manual Irrigation:<br>
                This a labour intensive and time-consuming system of irrigation. Here, the water is distributed through
                watering cans by manual labour.</li>
            <li>Sub Irrigation:<br>
                Water is distributed through a system of pumping stations gates, ditches and canals by raising the water
                table.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
