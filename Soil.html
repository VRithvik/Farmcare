    <h3 align="center" style="background-color: yellow; color: darkgreen;">About Soils</h3>
    <p>Soil is the loose surface that cover the land. Soil consists of organic and inorganic matter. Soil plays
        important
        role in the farming.Soil varies in terms of texture,color,depth and stone content.The good soil structure allow
        plant to stay healthy by allowing water and air.Soil also help in storing water for plant growth.In farming
        monitering the characteristics of soil and understanding the soil condition is very important.</p>
    <p>In India their are total of seven soil deposits they are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Alluvial Soil</li>
        <li>Black Soil</li>
        <li>Red Soil</li>
        <li>Laterite Soil</li>
        <li>Forest and Mountainous Soil</li>
        <li>Marsh Soil</li>
        <li>Arid Soil</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <h4>Alluvial Soil :</h4>
    <p>The alluvial soil is <b>very fertile</b> in nature.this soil contain <b>potash,phosphoric acid and
            lime.</b>Alluvial soil is deposited by the Indus,the Ganges and Brahamaputra rivers.The entire northern
        plains and west are made of alluvial soil.Alluvial soil also found in some parts of eastern coastal
        plains.Alluvial soil gives good yeilds in <b>sugarcane,paddy,wheat</b></p>
    <h4>Black Soil :</h4>
    <p>Black soil also known as regur soil.The black soils are made up of <b>clayey soil</b> well known for their
        capacity to
        hold moisture because of their high clay content.Black soil is typical of the Deccan trap region spread over
        northwests Deccan plateau and is made up of lava flows and extend in the south-east direction.Black soil is rich
        in <b>calcium carbonate, magnesium, potash and lime</b>.Black soil is ideal for growing <b>cotton</b> and is
        known as black
        cotton soil.</p>
    <h4>Red Soil :</h4>
    <p>Red Soil is also known as Omnibus soil.Red soils contain large amounts of <b>clay</b>.Red soils develop a reddish
        colour
        due to diffusion of <b>iron in crystalline,ferric oxide and metamorphic rocks</b>.Red soil develops on
        crystalline
        igneous rocks in areas of low rainfall in the eastern and southern parts of the Deccan plateau.Red soil is ideal
        for growning <b>Wheat, pulses, tobacco, oilseeds, potatoes, etc.</b></p>
    <h4>Laterite Soil :</h4>
    <p> Laterite soil is rich with vital nutrients and is widely used.Laterite is a soil and rock type rich in iron and
        aluminium and is commonly considered to have formed in hot and wet tropical areas.Laterite soil is reddish to
        yellow in color with a lower content of potassium, phosphorus, nitrogen, lime, and magnesia.Laterite soil is
        suitable for growing coffee, tea, rubber, coconut, cinchona, etc.</p>
    <h4>Forest and Mountainous Soil :</h4>
    <p>Forest and Mountainous soils are heterogeneous in nature, and their character changes with the environment and
        altitude.These soils are very rich in humus, but are deficient in potash, phosphorous and lime.Forest and
        Mountainous soil is suitable for plantation of tea, coffee, spices and tropical fruits.</p>
    <h4>Marsh Soil :</h4>
    <p>Marsh soil are wetland that is dominated by herbaceous rather than woody plant species.Marsh Soil can often be
        found at the edges of lakes and streams, where they form a transition between the aquatic and terrestrial
        ecosystems. They are often dominated by grasses, rushes or reeds.Marsh soil provide habitats for many kinds of
        invertebrates, fish, amphibians, waterfowl and aquatic mammals.</p>
    <h4>Arid Soil :</h4>
    <p>Arid soil is one of the most predominant soil orders found on the planet, also known as desert soil.This soil is
        brown and red in color and sandy in texture.The arid soils usually comprise high concentrations of gypsum,
        calcium carbonates, and sodium.The soil comprises a significant concentration of soluble salts.The soil lacks
        moisture and humus.The soil is generally not suitable for the majority of crop production.</p>
